# Simple RAG Tutorial


A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines information retrieval with language generation. It works by searching a collection of documents to find relevant content for a user's question, then uses that information to generate a helpful answer. 

In this project, the RAG system reads a PDF document, retrieves the most relevant sections based on your query, and presents the answer in a user-friendly web app.

See deployed app version here:

I used the Cursor agent on Auto model select to help build this project.

**Benefits of automating this process include:**
- **Faster information retrieval:** Instantly find relevant content without manual searching.
- **Improved accuracy:** Reduces the risk of missing important details in large documents.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the same process is followed every time, minimizing human error.
- **Reduced Hallucination:** The RAG system only returns information that actually exists in your documents, minimizing the risk of generating made-up or inaccurate answers. This means you get reliable, document-grounded responses instead of AI "hallucinations."
- **Time savings:** Frees up time for more valuable tasks by automating repetitive lookups.
- **Scalability:** Easily handles multiple or large documents as your needs grow.
- **Checklist Tracking:** The system can help maintain a checklist of compliance tasks or requirements, marking off what has already been completed. This ensures nothing is overlooked and provides a clear record of progress.
